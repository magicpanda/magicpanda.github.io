    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Warm Neutrals with Soft Blue/Teal accents) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A task-oriented SPA with a top navigation bar and five distinct sections: 1. Dashboard/Overview with a visual breakdown of the exam. 2. Interactive Vocabulary Explorer with thematic filtering and search. 3. 30-Day Study Plan presented as a weekly accordion. 4. Grammar Reference with a tabbed/accordion interface. 5. Exam Skills & Tips section. This structure deconstructs the linear report into a user-friendly, non-linear tool, allowing students to easily access specific study materials as needed, which is more effective for daily study and revision than a long, scrollable document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Exam Structure -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Visually communicates score weighting better than text/table -> Library: Chart.js. 2. Vocabulary List -> Goal: Organize/Explore -> Method: Thematic filter buttons + dynamic list -> Interaction: Click to filter, type to search -> Justification: Makes a large word list manageable and interactive for study -> Method: Vanilla JS DOM manipulation. 3. 30-Day Plan -> Goal: Organize/Guide -> Method: Weekly Accordion -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse -> Justification: Prevents information overload and focuses user on a weekly basis -> Method: Vanilla JS. 4. Grammar/Skills -> Goal: Reference -> Method: Tabs/Accordion -> Interaction: Click to show content -> Justification: Standard UI for organizing dense reference material -> Method: Vanilla JS. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
